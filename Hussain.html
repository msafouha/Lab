        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Hussain Ali, and I am a senior Computer Science student at AUS. I chose Computer Science because of its versatility and the endless career opportunities it provides. I enjoy problem-solving and exploring different fields, from game development to banking and database management. I also love working on personal coding projects and challenging myself with new technologies. The logical and creative aspects of programming keep me motivated to keep learning and improving my skills.

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The main reason is that this course is a requirement for me to graduate :) but other than that, I believe it provides valuable information, typically pertaining to different methods of tackling a project and how to work in teams.
            </li>
                
        </ul>
        
        <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
        <p>Gaming
            Watching various sports (mainly the NFL at the moment)
            Honing my programming skills
            I love exploring new technologies and challenging myself with personal coding projects.

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>I once built a cart using an Arduino circuit board that could follow people around. It was like having a robotic pet! That project was so cool, it ended up inspiring me to pursue a degree in computer science.</p>
